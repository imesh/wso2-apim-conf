# WSO2 API Manager Configurations

This repository contains default configurations required for setting up WSO2 API Manager on any infrastructure according to well-known deployment patterns. The idea of this is to let users setup WSO2 API Manager in no time just by updating parameters that would only change based on external resources such as hostnames, and data sources.

## All-In-One Active-Active Deployment Pattern

In this deployment pattern there will be two all-in-one API Manager instances and one API Manager Analytics instance. In the near future configurations required for two API Manager Analytics instances will be added. 

Please navigate to [all-in-one-pattern](/all-in-one-pattern) folder for detailed information.
